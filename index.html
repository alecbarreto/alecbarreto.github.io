    <h4> Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated with
        how computer systems worked. As I grew older and my curiousity and
        investigative skills grew, I began to learn more and more about
        the history and inner worknigs of computers and the internet.
        I plan to continue my studies so that I can one day know all there is
        to know about the world of computation, and hopefully use that
        knowledge to make a real difference.</h4>
