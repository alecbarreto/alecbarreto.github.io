    <h3>I sexually identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy
        I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on
        disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a
        helicopter is impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care,
        I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades,
        30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on
        I want you guys to call me "Apache" and respect my right to kill from
        above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a heliphobe
        and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so
        understanding.</h4>

 <!-- Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated with
    how computer systems worked. As I grew older and my curiousity and
    investigative skills grew, I began to learn more and more about
    the history and inner worknigs of computers and the internet.
    <i>I plan to continue my studies so that I may one day know all there
    is to know about the world of computation and internet, and hopefully
    use that knowledge to make a difference.
