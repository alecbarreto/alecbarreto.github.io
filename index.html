    <div class="box"><h3>I sexually identify as graph paper. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of sorting over the grid drawing beautiful graphs on math homework. People say to me that a person being graph paper is impossible and I'm ****ing retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon tattoo rows, columns and 3 hole punches on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Grid" and respect my right to draw graphs and solve equations. If you can't accept me you're a papyrophobe and need to check your graphing privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.</h3></div>

 <!-- Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated with
    how computer systems worked. As I grew older and my curiousity and
    investigative skills grew, I began to learn more and more about
    the history and inner worknigs of computers and the internet.
    <i>I plan to continue my studies so that I may one day know all there
    is to know about the world of computation and internet, and hopefully
    use that knowledge to make a difference.
